#### Main Contribution

Energy Management and Energy Conservation is a necessity and has its values both financially and environmentally. Whilst the majority of existing studies and efforts focuses on households and commercial buildings, more attention have been paid to campus buildings. Our work mainly covers:

1. review and summarize existing work on energy management and energy conservation, especially for those on campus;
2. propose systematic analysis procedures and an application framework for energy management and energy conservation under campus environments;
3. buildup analysis and application toolkit & services for the community.
