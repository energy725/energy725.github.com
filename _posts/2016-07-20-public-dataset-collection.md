#### UK-DALE: UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity Dataset

[Dataset Resource Site](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dk3810/data)

**Introduction**

This dataset records the power demand from five houses. In each house the data contributor records both the whole-house mains power demand every six seconds as well as power demand from individual appliances every six seconds. In three of the six houses, the whole-house voltage and current are also recorded at 16 kHz and every second.

This dataset will be updated as more data is recorded. Each release of the dataset is labelled with the month and year. The most recent release is for May 2016. UK-DALE now includes 3.5 years of data for house 1.

*Remarks*: the introduction above is from the data site and please refer it for more details.
